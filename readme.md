# SIMPLE TASKBOARD

## Intro 
This is a single webpage application that serves as an interactive taskboard. There are three sections, to-do, in-progress, and done. Task cards are color-coded by due date.

## Usage 
Clicking the 'Add Task' button will bring up a modal with three forms to fill out: A task title, a due date, and a description. Clicking the 'submit' button will create a task card, initially pinned onto the 'to-do' section. Users can click and drag the card into other sections based on the activity status of the task. Each card has a delete button that will erase the task from both the local storage and the task board.
